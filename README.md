## Features

This isn't a ready-to-use game. It's a library of loosely-coupled components that
implement some of Visual Pinball's features.

Visual Pinball's player can be split into three parts:

1. The rendering engine
2. The physics engine
3. The scripting engine
    
This library allows exporting a VPX file into a [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
scene, which covers the first point. A physics loop is implemented by the `Player`
class. Collision detection and rigid body dynamics will be fully ported, covering
the second part. The third part is still TODO, more details can be found [here](https://github.com/freezy/vpweb/issues/1).  
    
### Rendering 

VPX-JS allows reading a VPX file file and exporting a three.js scene directly
in the browser. However, it also supports export to [GLTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)
files, which is nice, because it allows off-loading the export to a server.

So why use this when Visual Pinball already has an [OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file)
export feature? Well, VPX-JS does some more things:

- GLTF is somewhat more powerful than OBJ. It allows us to include materials, 
  textures and lights in one single file.
- VPX-JS does some optimizations when reading data from the `.vpx` file:
   - PNG textures with no transparency are converted to JPEG
   - PNG textures with transparency are [PNG-crushed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pngcrush)
   - Meshes are compressed using [Draco](https://google.github.io/draco/)
- It's platform-independent, so you can run it on Linux and MacOS as well.

### Physics

VPX-JS uses the same physics code than Visual Pinball. That means the gameplay
is identical in the browser than when running VPX. 

### Scripting and VPM

For scripting, see [this issue](https://github.com/freezy/vpweb/issues/1). About
VPM, there isn't a JavaScript implementation of PinMAME yet. However, @neophob
wrote a [WPC emulator](https://github.com/neophob/wpc-emu) from scratch that will
cover many games already. 

## Installation

Clone the repo and use it! At some point it'll be on NPM.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vpdb/vpx-js.git
cd vpx-js
npm run build
```

## Usage

WIP. The API will be documented when it's considered stable.

## Tests

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

For more infos about how tests are written, see [here](https://github.com/vpdb/vpx-js/tree/master/test#readme)
