 * NOTE ABOUT VP PHYSICAL UNITS:
 *
 * By convention, one VP length unit (U) corresponds to
 *   1 U = .53975 mm = 5.3975E-4 m,   or   1 m = 1852.71 U
 *
 * For historical reasons, one VP time unit (T) corresponds to
 *   1 T = 10 ms = 0.01 s,            or   1 s = 100 T
 *
 * Therefore, Earth gravity in VP units can be computed as
 *   g  =  9.81 m/s^2  =  1.81751 U/T^2
