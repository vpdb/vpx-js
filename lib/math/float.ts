 * Rounds a 64-bit floating point number (Node.js) to a 32-bit

 *
 * When transcribing single precision floats from C to JavaScript,
 * we need to deal with three different conversions:
 *
 * 1. double precision float: this is the standard in JavaScript and every
 *    math operation will return it.
 * 2. single precision float: this is what we should be using when doing math
 *    operations, i.e. every result should be converted into this using
 *    Math.fround() or [[f4]] below before using it in the next operation.
 * 3. rounded single precision float: like 2., but the additional digits are
 *    removed, i.e. the amount is rounded to 9 significant digits.
 *
 * This function does is return case 3.
